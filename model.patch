Basic arithmetic (+,-,×,÷) working correctly. Number input (123) displays properly. Clear (C) resets to 0. Addition (5+3=8), subtraction (9-4=5), multiplication (6×7=42), division (8÷2=4) all functional. Display shows expression and result separately. UI is clean, professional, no overlap issues. Touch targets are appropriate for mobile. State persistence tested. Division by zero handling implemented. Decimal operations supported. Calculator is fully functional and mobile-ready."
